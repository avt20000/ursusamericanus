    <div class="h1"><i>WHAT??</i></div>
    <div class="h2">I’m from Washington State. This is on the complete other side of the United States. 
    I think something that people tend to forget is that America is enormous. It’s faster and cheaper for me to 
    fly to Europe from NYC than it is for me to fly home. The vastness of America, I think, has led to each state 
    and major city to develop its own culture, identity, and social fabric. The point I’m trying to make with this 
    is that I experienced a very unique culture shock when moving from coast to coast, which I didn’t expect. Even though
     I’m still in the same country, everything is completely different. My entire way of life went through a transition over 
     the past year. </div>
    <div class="h1"><i>WHY??</i></div>
    <div class="h2">I want to document everything that I found strange, new, or had to adjust to since moving here. I think it’s important to 
    demonstrate the culture of where I come from and compare it with the culture I’m trying to integrate into.</div>
    <div class="h1"><i>WHO??</i></div>
    <div class="h2">My target audience would be other people around my age range, or honestly anyone making a big change in their life. I want these new things to feel more benign, 
    and open them up to discussion so that people don’t feel so alone about it..</div>
    <div class="h1" style="text-decoration: underline;">Guiding Principles</div>
    <div class="h1"><i>Handmade Aesthetic</i></div>
    <div class="h2">This is my experience. I want the aesthetic of the website to be completely mine. I want to achieve this by 
        layering a lot of hand drawn elements such as images and typefaces. This is important to me because I need the website to 
        be reflective of my personal experience, and effectively tell the story I want to communicate. </div>
    <div class="h1"><i>Accessibility</i></div>
    <div class="h2">The website needs to document several stories that come together to form a bigger picture. The flow, readability, 
        and navigability of the website all need to be extremely accessible and simple to understand. This is important because it will 
        prevent the hindrance bad accessibility can have on effective storytelling. </div>
        <div class="h1"><i>Engagement with Story</i></div>
        <div class="h2">This should be a fun website. It needs to be interactive, engaging, and keep users wanting to see the next 
            installment. This is important because a good story needs to keep users engaged, so the design of the website should be 
            suited towards interactivity and interest.
